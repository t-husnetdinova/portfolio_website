                        <p class="card-text"> The main goal of creating this site was to further explore and realize 
                        my creative side and my passion for full-stack development and design that makes sense. 
                        It's a Student Portfolio site that will support my resume by showcasing 
                        my Computer Science and Digital Design projects.
                        The works featured on the site will include my Senior Design project and a future Independent
                        Study in Game Development; I will make sure to include other accomplishments like hackathons
                        and smaller case studies as well. The most exciting and rewarding part is how hands-on and
                        practical the product of this independent study has been, rather than being something strictly
                        theory-based and intangible.
                        The goal of the project was to implement a robust website in Javascript and its many
                        frameworks, and go beyond the basics to explore advanced concepts related to the CSCI3916
                        Web API course I took with Shawn, who was also my faculty mentor throughout this project. 
                        We explored modern user experience design, from putting together a storyboard to a fully-fledged UI/UX
                        high-fidelity prototype. And from there, I implemented the visuals for the website using CSS
                        and elements created in Adobeâ€™s Photoshop and Illustrator.The goal was to create a responsive
                        website that scales well between different devices and browsers. I got to explore
                        more advanced topics in Web Development and Design, like integration with headless CMS to
                        support content authoring, Search Engine Optimization, and metadata. And now, I have a pretty neat site!</p>
